This project is modify from Tencent/behaviac

Currently It only support C# and Server version.(Not contain Unity) .

That is need to changed your files(AgentProperties) which are generated from Behaviac Designer.

It looks like a number of steps for a lot of trouble . 

Maybe I'll update it in the future make him easier to use. 

Thank you.
